    <h2 class="text-center">I purchased a van to live (and work)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Two weeks after <a href="/posts/how-i-was-fired">I was fired from my own company</a>, I quit the flat I was renting and purchased a van to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
    I had never slept in a van before. But I wanted to try.<br>
    For seven thousands euros, I bought an 1989's Acapulco 58.<br>
    It was all I needed: a furnished house, an office, and a car.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    For the same price, I could have barely bought one square meter in Paris.
    And you can't do a lot with that space apart to place a washing machine (which you have to buy first).
    It's how I realized that most people must work a whole year in their life to own a washing machine in Paris (space + machine + electricity). I'll go to laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
    But let me give you a quick tour of my new mobile-home-office.
    There are 3 double beds: one in a real bedroom, one above the cockpit and a extra one thanks to the convertible table.
    In the kitchen, you have two gas rings, a fridge, a sink and a surface to cook.
    In the bathroom, you can enjoy a shower with hot water, a sink and toilets.
    And in the living room, you have a table/desk, many cupboards and a gas heater.<br>
    If you have got this far with me, six persons can leave in there. But I'm alone :)

    Gasoline: to move the beast
    Water: for showers and cooking
