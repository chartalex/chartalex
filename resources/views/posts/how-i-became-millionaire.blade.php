    <h2 class="text-center">How I became a millionaire</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Where I grew up, people measure your success according to how much you make.<br>
    I know, it's strange. But still. I had to find a plan not to be a looser.
    </p>
    <p>
	Because I couldn't play football as Cristiano Ronaldo, I had only 2 ways to make millions quickly, and legally:<br>
	 - Win at lottery<br>
	 - Found a startup<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    The first option was tempting but too risky. Even more risky after I learnt that I had more chance to become French President than to win at lottery. And I didn't want to be President.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
	Then, I had only one option to make millions: found a Startup.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
	So I went to a business school <s>to party</s> to learn the basics.<br>
	I started a first project, and became an entrepreneur.<br>
	I started a second project, and became a web developper.<br>
	Finally, I got a good idea, started a third project and became a start-upper.<br>
	One year later, I was millionaire.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Actually, I was just a virtual millionaire because I never had a million on my bank account.
	To get the millions in cash, I should have sold my shares.<br>
	But what for? The day I became millionaire, I understood I didnâ€™t want to.<br>
